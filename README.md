# League of Legends Team Damage Win Predicter

## What is this?
This is just a small project of mine where I tried to create a 'support-vector-machine-based' machine learning model
which will predict the outcome of a game based on the total damage dealt by both teams in previous ranked games I have played.

## Isn't this just a matter of who does more damage?
Sort of (I mean in a real game it's not necessarily true that whichever team deals the most damage will win the game).
But anyhow, this is just something for me to see whether I can create a model that can use SVM to attempt to predict
whether the ally team will win based purely on the (admittedly very small) dataset of team damage across ranked games I
have played.
